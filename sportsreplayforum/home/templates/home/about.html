        <h5 class="inside-header">About</h5>

        <p>Our aim is to help sports fans determine whether it is worth spending their time watching an event.</p>
        <p>No one likes to spend 2hrs watching a dull race or a 0-0 match when there are so many other things to be doing.</p>
        <p>You can check our rating system to see how other fans and our continuously improving AI rating system will recommend to watch.</p>
        <p>And you can help other users by registering and rating events yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to rights issues and restrictions, we are unable to provide replay streams. Use your favourite sports package or online stream to find replays</p>
